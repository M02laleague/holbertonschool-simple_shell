In this project, I implemented several different sorting algorithms.

* **Team:** Project to be done in teams of 2 people

## Description

This project implements a simple Unix command line interpreter (shell) that can execute commands, handle user input, and manage the environment. The shell mimics basic functionalities of the `/bin/sh` shell, allowing users to run commands and see outputs in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain how a shell works and its components.
- Understand process management including PID and PPID.
- Manipulate the environment of the current process.
- Differentiate between functions and system calls.
- Create processes and execute programs using `execve`.
- Handle end-of-file (EOF) conditions and errors.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`.

- Code must adhere to the Betty style guidelines.
- Ensure no memory leaks occur in the implementation.
- Each header file must be include guarded.
- Use system calls only when necessary.

## Usage

To run the shell in interactive mode, execute:
```bash
./hsh
```

## Built-in Commands

-exit: Exits the shell.
-env: Prints the current environment variables.

## File Structure

- README.md: Project description and instructions.
- AUTHORS: List of contributors.
- man_1_simple_shell: Manual page for the shell.
- shell.c: Core functionalities of the shell.
- shell.h: Header file containing function declarations.

## Flowcharts
- Shell 0.1
